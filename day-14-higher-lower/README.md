I made several noteworthy improvements to this capstone project:

1. Instead of Instagram, I sourced the top 1,000 most popular YouTube channels as game data. When you run setup.py it will download the current top 1,000 list from the Internet.

2. I use JSON to store game data. Separating data from code is important.

3. The user interface is clean and the screen will clear between games.
